            Lekha: Today Glyph and I are here to talk about Mimic. An
            opensource framework that allows for testing of OpenStack and
            Rackspace APIs.
            <br>
            Mimic has been making testing across products in Rackspace a cake
            walk. And we think it could do the same for the OpenStack- backed
            applications someday. Today, We are not there yet. But your
            contributions will help us get there soon.

            services that Mimic implements.

          <h1>Why?</h1>
          <aside class="notes">

            Glyph: While Mimic is hopefully general purpose, it was originally
            created for testing a specific application: Rackspace Auto Scale.
            So let's talk about that.

          <h1>Auto Scale</h1>
          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: Rackspace Auto Scale is a system which automates the process
            of getting the right amount of compute capacity for an application,
            by creating (scaling up) and deleting (scaling down) servers and
            associating them with load balancers.

          <h2>(of Auto Scale)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Lekha: In order to perform these tasks, Auto Scale speaks to three
            back-end Rackspace APIs.

          <h1>Rackspace Identity</h1>

          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: Rackspace Identity is API-compatible with OpenStack
            Identity v2. Rackspace Cloud Servers is powered by and API-
            compatible with OpenStack Compute. Although Rackspace Cloud Load
            Balancers is a custom API.

          <h1>Testing</h1>
          <h2>(for Auto Scale)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: As Auto Scale was interacting with so many other systems,
            testing Auto Scale did not mean <b>just</b> testing features of Auto
            Scale. But also that, if any of these systems it depended on did not
            behave as expected, Auto Scale did not crumble or crash, but was consistent
            and able to handle these upstream failures gracefully.

          <h1>Functional</h1>
          <h2>(API contracts)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: One, was the Functional tests to validate the API
            contracts. These tests verified the responses of the Auto Scale
            API calls given valid, or malformed requests.

            Lekha: And the other was the System integration tests. Theese,
            were more complex. These tests verified integration between Auto

          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: For example: When a scaling group was created, one such test will verify
            that the servers on that group were provisioned successfully. That
            is, that the servers went into an 'active' state and were added as a nodes to the
            load balancer on the sceling group.

            Lekha: Or, if a server went into an error state, (yes! that can happen!),
            Auto Scale was able to re-provision that server succefully, and then add that
            active server to the load balancer on the scaling group.

          <h1>Testing Problems</h1>
          <h2>(with Auto Scale)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: All these tests were set up to run against the real services.
            And... here are some observations I had while writing the tests:
            Servers could take over a minute, or ten minutes, or longer to
            provision. And the tests would run that-much-longer.
            <br>
            Sometimes, the tests would fail! due to raandom upstream failures.
            Like a server would go into 'error' state, where as the <b>test</b> was
            expecting it to go into an 'active' state.
            <br>
            And tests for such negative scenarios, like actually testing how
            Auto Scale would behave if the server did go into 'error' state,
            could not be tested. This is something that could <b>not</b> be
            reproduced consistently.

          <h1>More Problems</h1>
          <h2>(with Auto Scale)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            Lekha: Well, the overall test coverage was improving. And I
            continued to add tests, oblivious of the time it was taking run
            the entire test suite!
            <br>
            Later, we had started using these tests as a <em>gate</em>, in our merge
            pipeline.
            <br>
            But, the tests were running for <b>so</b> long and were sometimes flaky.
            Nobody dared to run these tests locally! Not even me, when I was
            adding more tests!
            <br>
            Also, our peers from the compute and load balancers teams, whose
            resources we were using up for our "Auto-scale" testing, were
            <em>not</em> happy! So much, so that, we were <em>pretty</em> glad, we were in a
            remote office!

            testing in the real world.  Most interactions with services are
            successful, and the operators of those services always strive to
            make ever more of those interactions successful.  So most likely,
            the positive-path code is going to get exercised all the time and
            you will have plenty of opportunities to flush out bugs.

            is typical, it probably doesn't have as much hardware, or as many
            concurrent users, as your production environment.  Every additional
            piece of harware or concurrent user is another opportunity for
            failure, so that means your staging environment is probably even
            less likely to fail.

            from the bad old days of the 90s, when most teams didn't have build

            A well behaved OpenStack client will use the service catalog to
            look up URLs for its service endpoints. Such a client will only
            need two pieces of configuration to begin communicating with the
            cloud, i.e. credentials and the identity endpoint. A client
            written this way will only need to change the Identity endpoint to
            be that of Mimic.

            wasn't entirely true - sometimes Mimic pretends to *not* create a
            server.  It uses the metadata provided during the creation of the
            server, inspects the metadata, and sets the state of the server
            respectively.

            Lekha: Lets go back to the demo and see how this can be done. We
            are creating a server with `metadata`: `"server_building": 30`.
            This... will make the server stay in building state for 30
            seconds. Similarly, servers can also be made to go into error state
            on creation, using the `metadata`: `"server_error": True`.

          <h1>Retry On Errors</h1>

            Lekha: For the purposes of Auto Scale it was important that we have
            right number of servers on a scaling group, even if a number of
            attempts to create one failed. We chose to use `metadata` for error
            injection so that requests with injected errors could also be run
            against real services. For Auto Scale, the expected end result is
            the same number of servers created, irrespective of the number of
            failures. But this behavior may also be useful to many other
            applications because retrying is a common pattern for handling
            errors.

            Glyph: However, the first implementation of mimic had some flaws,
            it was fairly Rackspace specific and only implemented the endpoints
            of the services that Autoscale depends upon . And they were all
            implemented as part of Mimic's core. It ran each service on a
            different port, meaning that for N endpoints you would need not
            just N port numbers, but N *consecutive* port numbers. It allowed
            for testing error scenarios, but only using the metadata. This was
            not useful for all cases, for example, for a control panel that
            does not not allow every UI action to contain
            metadata.  <!-- (TODO: ask someone if Horizon matches this

              APIs have catalog entries for each API type, which in turn have
              endpoints for each virtual region they represent.

            <p>
              This takes the form of an iterable of a class called `Entry`,
              each of which is a name and a collection of `Endpoint` objects,
              each containing a region, a URI version prefix, and a tenant ID
              of its own.

            Glyph: `resource_for_region` takes the name of a region, a URI
            prefix - produced by Mimic core to make URI for each service unique
            - and a session store where the API mock may look up state of the
            resources it pretended to provision for the respective
            tenants. `resource_for_region` returns an HTTP resource associated
            with the top level of the given region.  This resource then routes
            this request to any tenant- specific resources associated with the
            full URL path.

            Glyph: Mimic uses the Twisted plugin system, which has a very
            simple model of how plugins work: you have an abstract interface -
            some methods and attributes that you expect of a plugin - and then
            plugins register themselves by instantiating a provider of that
            interface and placing that instance into a module within a
            particular namespace package.  In Mimic's case, that interface is
            `IAPIMock` and that package is `mimic.plugins`.

            some time before it is active, __but__ it would remain in building
            state for over an hour or even would sometimes go into an error

            mimics exclusively existing APIs, there are very few design
            decisions.  As a result, contributing to Mimic is a lot easier than
            contributing to OpenStack proper.
