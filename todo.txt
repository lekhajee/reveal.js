    - general->specific / specific->general

        - call out what "general" refers to (mocking, testing for failure) and
          what "specific" refers to (mimic itself, autoscale)

    - error repository slides

        - what errors are currently present (talk about presets & preset API
          endpoint, maybe?)

        - what is the plan for the future for making the repository of response
          types more discoverable?
